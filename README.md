# AES-Project
This is a small implementation of AES programmed in Rust. There isn't a developed UI or anything as the purpose of this project was to improve my proficiency in Rust, Programming in general, and Cryptography. Imported a minimal amount of crates as that would have reduced my workload which goes against the purpose of this project.
