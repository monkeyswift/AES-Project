# AES-Project
Trying to implement AES encryption in rust.
All of the code here is very broken right now and a work in progress, pls don't bully me. Some of the notes also make no sense but I promise they did before they *went out of scope*.
I think it is worth mentioning that I am doing my best to avoid importing any crates for this project because my main objective is simply learning rust, and I believe that importing anything may rob me of lines of code that I can write myself.
