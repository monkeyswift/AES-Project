# AES-Project
Trying to implement AES encryption in rust.
All of the code here is very broken right now and a work in progress. Some of the notes also make no sense but I promise they did before they *went out of scope*.
I think it's worth mentioning that I am doing my best to avoid importing any crates for this project because my main objective is learning rust and cryptography; importing anything reduces my workload which obviously contradicts my goal.
